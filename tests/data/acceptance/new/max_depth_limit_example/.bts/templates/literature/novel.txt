A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.
The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".
